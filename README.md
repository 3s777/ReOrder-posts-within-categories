# ReOrder-posts-within-categories
This is a fork of the official plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/reorder-post-within-categories/)

**Fixed:**
- added a filter to allows decelopers to tweak the post query for ordering (v1.2.1) (see https://github.com/aurovrata/ReOrder-posts-within-categories/releases/tag/v1.2.1)
- cleaned up the languages and improved dashboard notifications (v1.2)
- major bug in Network (multisite) installation of WP (v1.1.7)
- some error issues found in the initial v1.1.6 (see thread: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/support-for-wp_query-object?replies=3)
- enable 'Editor' role to manage the post order within the Post/CPT sub-menu which makes more sense in my opinion.
- translated a few buttons/links into english

Tested till WP v4.3.1
